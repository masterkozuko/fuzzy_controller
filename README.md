 fuzzy_controller_system

========================

This is an ongoing project for controlling a quadrotor with fuzzylogic.

Right now we have to main programs.

Fuzzy_lander consist of using the bottom camera to identify a Augmented Reality tag and attemp to land on it. Currently it still needs more work.

Fuzzy_tracker uses the front camera to detect a AR tag, and attempts to keep the tag in the center of the frame. Currently working.

TODO: ROW YAW PITCH Control for both systems. Update from fuerte to indigo in progress
